This is just a simple Qt WebEngine wrapper around WhatsApp's web interface.

The goal was to make an app for GNU/Linux and enable it to have system notifications and the ability to be in the systemtray. This is, most definitely, a fast hack, but it serves my purpose. If you want to improve it in some way, feel free to make an issue or send a pull request. Since I generally use WhatsApp, and want it available on my desktop, I will definitely be maintaining this app indefinitely.
